## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- nunjucks
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this proyect, I tried to implement better my sass setup, also first I used clamp for the container width and for the fonts on tag, date, title and description, So I changed to a media query, It makes more sense because I'm using the same breakpoint and only I change one value, not using different transition values on a clamp function.
Also I run some accesibility test.
